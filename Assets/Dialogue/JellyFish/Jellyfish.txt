Little Mouse: There you are, Emily. I've been waiting for you.
Emily: How... how do you know my name?
Little Mouse: I've been watching you all this time, Emily. Of course, I know your name.
Emily: ...
Little Mouse: Come! Come join me.
Little Mouse: Why do people desire for more, when they have to leave everything when they die?
Little Mouse: Do you know why, Emily?
Emily: I uh...
Little Mouse: You seem as clueless as me. It's ok if you don't know how to answer that.
Little Mouse: You fought the monsters just as the fairies asked you to, right?
Emily: Yeah?
Little Mouse: Do you know what those monsters actually were?
Emily: ... 
Little Mouse: They were lost soul. They were once human just like you until they got tempted by desires and greed. They trade their souls to the fairies just for a wish.
Little Mouse: not long after their wish was granted, their souls were eaten by the fairies. And so they turn into monsters without soul.
Little Mouse: There was this one great mage who has successfully weaken the fairies but..
Little Mouse: The fairies keep luring children into their house, eating their souls one by one.
Little Mouse: The stronger the soul of the child, the more it can recover their strength.
Little Mouse: That's why they made you fight with the monsters. To make your soul even stronger.
Little Mouse: But I know that you won't get taken down by the fairies. Your soul is stronger than any person I have ever seen. 
Little Mouse: You are strong enough to defeat the fairies, once and for all. I just know it.
Little Mouse: That is why I call you.
Emily: But, I can't. I don't have the power to defeat them.
Little Mouse: You can, Emily. You can.
Little Mouse: I will lend you my power.
Little Mouse: Please, defeat them.
