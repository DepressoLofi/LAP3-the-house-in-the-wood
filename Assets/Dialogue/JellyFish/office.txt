Red Fairy: Oh, you are awake.
Emily: Where am I?
Red Fairy: We found you lying unconcious on the ground so we brought you here.
Emily: Oww...
Yellow Fairy: Little girl, can you help us?
Emily: .......
Blue Fairy: We've been trapped in this house. In order to set us free, you need to defeat the monsters in three dungeons.
Blue Fairy: When you go down the basement, you will find three portals that lead you to the dungeons.
Blue Fairy: You need to go into those portals and fight the monsters. But don't worry, we will give you a hand along the way.
Yellow Fairy: Will you help us? we really need your help.
Emily: uhh...
Emily: Yes, I think I can help.
Red Fairy: Good! But please rest for now.
